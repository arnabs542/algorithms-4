* 63. Unique Paths II
* https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/
*
* Follow up for "Unique Paths":
*
* Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?
*
* An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
*
* For example,
* There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
*
* [
*   [0,0,0],
*   [0,1,0],
*   [0,0,0]
* ]
* The total number of unique paths is 2.
*
* Note: m and n will be at most 100.
